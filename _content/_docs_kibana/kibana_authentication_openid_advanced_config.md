# Kibana OpenID Advanced Configuration
{: .no_toc}

{% include toc.md %}


This chapter lists all advanced configuration options for OIDC. Most of them are only needed for special setups.


## Mapping of JWT Claims to User Data

The name of the users and their roles are determined by so called claims stored in the JWTs which are provided by the IdP to Search Guard. You can control the mapping of these claims to user data using the following options:

**subject_key:** The key in the JSON payload that stores the user's name. If not defined, the [subject](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.2) registered claim is used. Most IdP providers use the `preferred_username` claim. Optional.

**roles_key:** The key in the JSON payload that stores the user's roles. The value of this key must be a comma-separated list of roles. 

**subject_pattern:**  A regular expression that defines the structure of an expected user name. You can use capturing groups to use only a certain part of the subject supplied by the JWT as the Search Guard user name. If the pattern does not match, login will fail. See [below](#using-only-certain-sections-of-a-jwt-subject-claim-as-user-name) for details. Optional, defaults to no pattern. 

## TLS Settings

If you need special TLS settings to create connections from Search Guard to the IdP, you can configure them with the options listed below. Such configuration might become necessary for example if your IdP uses TLS certificates which are signed by non-public certificate authorities.

**idp.tls.trusted_cas:** The root certificates to trust when connecting to the IdP. You can specify the certificates in PEM format inline or specify an absolute path name using the syntax `${file:/path/to/certificate.pem}`.

**idp.tls.enabled_protocols:** The enabled TLS protocols. Defaults to `["TLSv1.2", "TLSv1.1"]`. 

**idp.tls.enabled_ciphers:** The enabled TLS cipher suites. 

**idp.tls.verify_hostnames:** Whether to verify the hostnames of the IdPâ€™s TLS certificate or not. Default: true.

**idp.tls.trust_all:** Disable all certificate checks. You should only use this for quick tests. *Never use this for production systems.*


### Example

```
default:
  authcz:
  - type: oidc
    client_id: "my-kibana-client"
    client_secret: "client-secret-from-idp"
    idp.openid_configuration_url: "https://your.idp/.../.well-known/openid-configuration"
    idp.tls.trusted_cas: |
      -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
      MIIEZjCCA06gAwIBAgIGAWTBHiXPMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBCwUAMHgxEzARBgoJkiaJ
      [...]
      1k4enV7iJWXE8009a6Z0Ouwm2Bg68Wj7TAQ=
      -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    roles_key: "roles"
```

## TLS Client Authentication

If you need to use TLS client authentication to connect from Search Guard to the IdP, you can configure it using the following options:

**idp.tls.client_auth.certificate:** The client certificate. You can specify the certificate in PEM format inline or specify an absolute path name using the syntax `${file:/path/to/certificate.pem}`. You can also specify several certificates to specify a certificate chain.

**idp.tls.client_auth.private_key:** The private key belonging to the client certificate. You can specify the key in PEM format inline or specify an absolute path name using the syntax `${file:/path/to/private-key.pem}`. 

**idp.tls.client_auth.private_key_password:** If the private key is encrypted, you need to specify the key password using this option. 


## Proxy Settings

If the IdP is only reachable from Search Guard via an HTTP proxy, you can use the `idp.proxy` option to define the URI of the proxy. Optional, defaults to no proxy.

### Example

```
default:
  authcz:
  - type: oidc
    client_id: "my-kibana-client"
    client_secret: "client-secret-from-idp"
    idp.openid_configuration_url: "https://your.idp/.../.well-known/openid-configuration"
    idp.proxy: "https://your.outbreaking.proxy:8080"
    roles_key: "roles"
```


## Using only certain sections of a JWT subject claim as user name

In some cases, the subject claim in a JWT might be more complex than needed or wanted. For example, a JWT subject claim could be specified as an email address like `exampleuser@example.com`. The `subject_pattern` option gives you the possibility to only use the local part (i.e., `exampleuser`) as the user name inside Search Guard.

With `subject_pattern` you specify a regular expression that defines the structure of an expected user name. You can then use capturing groups (i.e., sections enclosed in round parentheses; `(...)`) to use only a certain part of the subject supplied by the JWT as the Search Guard user name.

For example:

```yaml
default:
  authcz:
  - type: oidc
    client_id: "my-kibana-client"
    client_secret: "client-secret-from-idp"
    subject_pattern: "^(.+)@example\.com$"
    roles_key: "roles"
```

In this example, `(.+)` is the capturing group, i.e., at least one character. This group must be followed by the string `@example.com`, which must be present, but will not be part of the resulting user name in Search Guard. If you try to login with a subject that does not match this pattern (e.g. `foo@bar`), login will fail.

You can use all the pattern features which the Java `Pattern` class supports. See the [official documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html) for details. 

Keep in mind that all capturing groups are used for constructing the user name. If you need grouping only because you want to apply a pattern quantifier or operator, you should use non-capturing groups: `(?:...)`. 

Example for using capturing groups and non-capturing groups:

```yaml
      subject_pattern: "^(.+)@example\.(?:com|org)$"
```

In this example, the group around `com` and `org` is required to use the alternative operator `|`. But it must be non-capturing, because otherwise it would show up in the user name.

You can however also use several capturing groups if you want to use these groups for the user name:

```yaml
      subject_pattern: "^(.+)@example\.com|(.+)@foo\.bar$"
```

## Logout URL

If you want to customize the URL which Kibana will navigate to when the user selects the "Logout" menu item, use the `logout` option.

```
default:
  authcz:
  - type: oidc
    client_id: "my-kibana-client"
    client_secret: "client-secret-from-idp"
    idp.openid_configuration_url: "https://your.idp/.../.well-known/openid-configuration"
    logout_url: "https://your.idp/logout"
    roles_key: "roles"
```

## Rate-limiting connections to the IdP

In theory it is possible to DOS attack an OpenID based infrastructure by sending tokens with randomly generated, non-existing key ids at a high frequency. In order to mitigate this, Search Guard will only allow a maximum number of new key ids in a certain time frame. If more unknown key ids are receievd, Search Guard will return a HTTP status code 503 (Service not available) and refuse to query the IdP. By defaut, Search Guard does not allow for more than 10 unknown key ids in a time window of 10 seconds. You can control these settings by the following configuration keys:

**refresh_rate_limit_count:**  The maximum number of unknown key ids in the time window. Default: 10

**refresh_rate_limit_time_window_ms:** The time window to use when checking the maximum number of unknown key ids, in milliseconds. Default: 10000
