# Anonymize fields in Elasticsearch documents
{: .no_toc}

{% include toc.md %}

Instead of removing sensitive fields from a document with [field-level security](../_docs_dls_fls/dlsfls_fls.md), you can also choose to anonymize them. At the moment this features is available for String based fields only and replaces the actual field value with a cryptographic hash. 

Field masking works well together with field-level security and can be applied to on a per-role and per-index basis. This gives you the flexibility of allowing certain roles to see sensitive fields in clear text, while anonymizing them for others.

## Hash algorithm and salts

Search Guard by default uses Blake2bDigest to calculate the hash. This alogorithm strives a very good balance between speed and security and has built-in support for a salt for randomized hashing.

## Setting the salt

You can set the salt in elasticsearch.yml like: 

```
searchguard.compliance.salt: abc123
```

| Name | Description |
|---|---|
| searchguard.compliance.salt | Salt to use when generating the hash value. Must be at least 32 characters, only ASCII is allowed. Optional.|
{: .config-table}

While setting a salt is optional, it is highly recommended to do so. 

## Configuring field masking

Field masking can be configured per role and index pattern, very similar to field-level security. You simply list the fields to be masked under the  `_masked_fields_` key in the role definition. Wildcards and nested documents are supported:

```yaml
hr_employee:
  index_permissions:
    - index_patterns:
      - 'humanresources'
      allowed_actions:
        - ...
      masked_fields:
        - field1
        - field2*
        - fieldx.fieldy
        - fielda.fieldb.*      
      
```

Field masking plays well together with [field-level security](../_docs_dls_fls/dlsfls_fls.md). You just need to make sure that the fields you want to mask are not excluded from the result by the field-level security configuration.

## Example

```yaml
hr_employee:
  index_permissions:
    - index_patterns:
      - 'humanresources'
      allowed_actions:
        - ...
      fls:
        - 'Designation'
        - 'Salary'
        - 'FirstName'
        - 'LastName'
        - 'Address'
      masked_fields:
        - '*Name'
        - 'Address'     
      
```

In this example only the fields `Designation`, `Salary`, `FirstName`, `LastName` and `Address` of documents in the index `humanresources` are included in the resulting documents. This is done by whitelisting these fields in the `_fls_` section of the role / index definition. In addition, the `FirstName`, `LastName` and `Address` are masked. A search result might look like:

```
{
  "_index" : "humanresources",
  "_type" : "employees",
  "_id" : "1",
  "_score" : 5.7807436,
  "_source" : {
    "Designation" : "Manager",
    "Salary" : 154000,
    "Address" : "c560467d662d919fe9d1439127a5d3dd7da027dbadfd677ed88367a38a90fc69",
    "FirstName" : "fe6d625e4d577ab9b57bc403027e7022edfc27743991d73b14c594d6a8462443",
    "LastName" : "2823cef66118a9dd3f1ceb523018c2c47e40d3d48471e42285aa8cb8d1531528"
  }
}
```

## Custom field masking
You can configure alternative hash algorithms (instead of Blake2bDigest) and you also can mask only a part of the field value.

### Defining an alternative hash algorithm

```yaml
hr_employee:
  index_permissions:
    - index_patterns:
      - 'humanresources'
      allowed_actions:
        - ...
      masked_fields:
        - '*Name::SHA-1'
        - 'Address::SHA-512'     
      
```

The above example means that all values of all fields ending with `Name` are anonymized with an SHA-1 hash and all values of the field `Address` are anonymized with an SHA-512. All hashing algorithms provided which are provided by your JVM are supported. This typically includes MD5, SHA-1, SHA-384, and SHA-512.

If you use the REST API to define your roles and masked fields then the validity or your alternative hash algorithm is checked.

### Pattern-based field anonymization

You can apply one or more regex patterns and replacement strings to configure how the value of a particular field will be anonymized.
The formal definition is `<field-pattern>::/<regex>/::<replacement-string>`. There can be multiple regex/replacement tuples whereas the result from one on the left side is passed as in input to the one on the right side (like piping in a shell). The regex can include `^` and `$`, they are not implicitly assumed. 

```yaml
hr_employee:
  index_permissions:
    - index_patterns:
      - 'humanresources'
      allowed_actions:
        - ...
      masked_fields:
        - 'lastname::/.*/::*'
        - '*ip_source::/[0-9]{1,3}$/::XXX::/^[0-9]{1,3}/::***'
   
      
```

The above example means that every field value of the field `lastname` is anonymized by replacing all characters with a *.
All values of all fields ending with `ip_source` are anonymized by replacing the last three numbers with XXX and then take this and anonymize it
by replacing the last three numbers with ***. So an example IP address of `100.200.121.212` will result in `100.200.***.XXX`.

If you use the REST API to define your roles and masked fields then the syntax of your patterns is checked.

## Effects on the compliance read history

The [compliance read history](../_docs_audit_logging/auditlogging_read_history.md) feature makes it possible to track read access to sensitive fields in your documents. For example, you can track access to the email field of customer records in order to stay GDPR compliant.

Access to masked fields are excluded from the read history, because the user has only seen that hash value, and not the email address in clear text.
