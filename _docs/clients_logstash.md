# Using logstash with Search Guard
{: .no_toc}

{% include_relative _includes/toc.md %}

Logstash connects to Elasticserch on the REST layer, just like a browser or curl. In order to use logstash with a Search Guard secured cluster:

* set up a logstash user with permissions to read and write to the logstash and beats indices
* configure logstash to use HTTPS instead of HTTP (optional, only applicable if you enabled HTTPS on the REST layer).

## Logstash user

The sample configuration files that ship with Search Guard already contain a `logstash` user with all required permissions. This user is configured in the internal user database and can be used as-is.

The corresponding Search Guard role in `sg_roles.yml` is `sg_logstash`. If you don't use the internal user database, map your logstash user to this role in `sg_roles_mapping.yml`.


The logtsash user is configured in the `elasticsearch` output section of `logstash.conf`:

```json
output {
    elasticsearch {
       user => logstash
       password => logstash
       ...
    }
}
```

## Setting up TLS/SSL

If you use TLS on the REST layer you need to configure logstash to use HTTPS instead of HTTP when talking to Elasticsearch. This is done in the `elasticsearch` output section of `logstash.conf`:

```json
output {
    elasticsearch {
       ...
       ssl => true
       ssl_certificate_verification => true
       truststore => "/path/to/elasticsearch-2.3.3/config/truststore.jks"
       truststore_password => changeit
    }
}
```

Setting `ssl` to true ensures that logstash uses HTTPS.

Logstash requires you to set the trusted root CAs via the `truststore` or `cacert` parameter in the configuration. This is the absolute path to either the truststore or the root CA in PEM format that contains the Certificate Authorityâ€™s certificate.

If you want logstash to verify the hostname of the certificate it receives from Elasticsearch, set the `ssl_certificate_verification` property to true. 

## logstash configuration example


```json
output {
    elasticsearch {
       user => logstash
       password => logstash
       ssl => true
       ssl_certificate_verification => true
       truststore => "/path/to/truststore.jks"
       truststore_password => changeit
    }
}
```

## Permissions for the logstash user

The required permissions for the logstash user are as follows:

```yaml
sg_logstash:
  readonly: true
  cluster:
    - CLUSTER_MONITOR
    - CLUSTER_COMPOSITE_OPS
    - indices:admin/template/get
    - indices:admin/template/put
  indices:
    'logstash-*':
      '*':
        - CRUD
        - CREATE_INDEX
    '*beat*':
      '*':
        - CRUD
        - CREATE_INDEX
```

### Using custom logstash index names

If you are writing to a different index than the default logstash index, you need to give the logstash user access to this index.

For example, if you configured the index to be `mylogstashindex`: 

```json
output {
    elasticsearch {
       user => logstash
       password => logstash
       ...
       index => "mylogstashindex"
    }
}
```

The logstash user must have permissions to manage this index:

```yaml
sg_logstash:
  readonly: true
  cluster:
    - CLUSTER_MONITOR
    - CLUSTER_COMPOSITE_OPS
    - indices:admin/template/get
    - indices:admin/template/put
  indices:
    ...
    'mylogstashindex':
      '*':
        - CRUD
        - CREATE_INDEX
```
