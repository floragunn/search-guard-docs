# Using Search Guard with X-Pack Machine Learning
{: .no_toc}

{% include_relative _includes/toc.md %}

Search Guard is compatible with the X-Pack Machine Learning component. 

This documentation assumes that you already installed and configured Kibana and the [Search Guard Kibana](kibana_installation.md) plugin.

## Elasticsearch: Install X-Pack and enable Machine Learning

Install X-Pack on every node in your Elasticsearch Cluster. Please refer to the official X-Pack documentation regarding [installation instructions](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/x-pack/current/installing-xpack.html){:target="_blank"}.

In `elasticsearch.yml`, disable X-Pack Security and enable X-Pack Machine Learning:


```yaml
xpack.security.enabled: false
xpack.ml.enabled: true
...
```

## Elasticsearch: Add the machine learning user

For using X-Pack Machine learning, the respective user must have the `sg_xp_machine_learning` and `sg_kibana_user` role assigned.

```yaml
sg_xp_machine_learning:
  readonly: true
  cluster:
    - cluster:admin/persistent*
    - cluster:internal/xpack/ml*
    - indices:data/read/scroll*
    - cluster:admin/xpack/ml*
    - cluster:monitor/xpack/ml*
  indices:
    '*':
      '*':
        - READ
        - indices:admin/get*
    '?ml-*':
      '*':
        - "*"
```

## Kibana: Install X-Pack

As with Elasticsearch, install X-Pack on Kibana. Please refer to the official X-Pack documentation regarding [installation instructions](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/x-pack/current/installing-xpack.html){:target="_blank"}.
      
## Kibana: Enable X-Pack Machine Learning

In `kibana.yml`, disable X-Pack Security and enable X-Pack Machine Learning:


```
xpack.security.enabled: false
xpack.ml.enabled: true
...
```
