# Active Directory and LDAP
{: .no_toc}

{% include_relative _includes/toc.md %}

Active Directory and LDAP can be used for authentication and authorisation thus it can be used both in the `authc` and `authz` section of the configuration. 

The `authc` section is used for configuring authentication, which means to check if the user has entered the correct credentials. The `authz` is used for authorisation, which defines how the role(s) for an authenticated user are retrieved and mapped.

In most cases, you want to configure both authentication and authorization, however, it is also possible to use authentication only and map the users retrieved from LDAP directly to Search Guard roles. 

## Where to go next

* Configure the [connection settings](ldap_connection_settings.md) for your Active Directory or LDAP server
* Use Active Directory and LDAP for [user authentication](ldap_authentication.md).
* Use Active Directory and LDAP for [user authorisation](ldap_authorisation.md).
