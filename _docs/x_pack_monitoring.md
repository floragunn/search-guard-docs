# Using Search Guard with X-Pack Monitoring
{: .no_toc}

{% include_relative _includes/toc.md %}

Search Guard is compatible with the free X-Pack monitoring component. At the moment, you can only use exporters of type `http`. 

This documentation assumes that you already installed and configured Kibana and the [Search Guard Kibana](kibana_installation.md) plugin.

## Elasticsearch: Install X-Pack and enable Monitoring

Install X-Pack on every node in your Elasticsearch Cluster. Please refer to the official X-Pack documentation regarding [installation instructions](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/x-pack/current/installing-xpack.html){:target="_blank"}.

In `elasticsearch.yml`, disable X-Pack Security and enable X-Pack Monitoring:

```yaml
xpack.security.enabled: false
xpack.monitoring.enabled: true
...
```

## Elasticsearch: Add the monitoring user

For the `http` monitoring type, add a user with all permissions to carry out the monitoring calls to your cluster. If you are using the demo configuration files, assign the roles `sg_xp_monitoring` and the `sg_kibana_user` role to this user.

```yaml
sg_xp_monitoring:
  readonly: true
  indices:
    '?monitor*':
      '*':
        - INDICES_ALL
```

## Elasticsearch: Configure a monitoring exporter

At the moment Search Guard supports exporters of type `http` only. Configure your `http` exporter, and configure the user you have mapped to the `sg_xp_monitoring` and the `sg_kibana_user` role in the last step:

```yaml
xpack.monitoring.exporters:
  id1:
    type: http
    host: ["https://127.0.0.1:9200"]
    auth.username: monitor
    auth.password: monitor
    ssl:
      truststore.path: truststore.jks
      truststore.password: changeit
```

| Name | Description |
|---|---|
| host  |  The hostname of the cluster to monitor |
| auth.username  |  The username of the user mapped to the monitor role|
| auth.password  |  The password of the user mapped to the monitor role|
| truststore.path | the truststore that contains the Root CA and intermediate certificates used to sign the certificates of the cluster to monitor |
| truststore.password | the password for the truststore |

## Kibana: Install X-Pack

As with Elasticsearch, install X-Pack on Kibana. Please refer to the official X-Pack documentation regarding [installation instructions](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/x-pack/current/installing-xpack.html){:target="_blank"}.
      
## Kibana: Enable X-Pack Monitoring

In `kibana.yml`, disable X-Pack Security and enable X-Pack Monitoring:

```yaml
xpack.security.enabled: false
xpack.monitoring.enabled: true
...
```

## Known issues and limitations

### Exporter types

At the moment, only `http` is supported.
